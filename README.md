# 100xDevs Web3 Development Cohort 🌐⛓️

Welcome to my **100xDevs Web3 Development** repository! This repo showcases all the projects, code, and assignments I've completed as part of the **100xDevs Web3 Development Cohort** led by [Harkirat Singh](https://github.com/harkiratSingh).

## What's Inside 📂

Each week of the cohort is organized into its own subfolder, where you'll find:
- **Project Code:** Implementation of various Web3 and blockchain-related projects.
- **Assignments:** Solutions to assignments and exercises.
- **Learning Notes:** Key concepts and techniques explored during the week.

Feel free to dive into the folders to see how I've been building my Web3 development skills throughout the program.
